## Overview

Welcome to the **Next.js SST Starter**! This repository provides an opinionated starter template for building applications with Next.js and deploying them on AWS using SST (Serverless Stack). It simplifies the process of setting up your development environment and deploying your app with best practices in mind.

To get started, you can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Tofu1304/nextjs-sst-starter/releases) and execute the necessary commands to set up your project.

## Features

- **Opinionated Structure**: Designed with best practices in mind.
- **Serverless Deployments**: Easily deploy your app on AWS.
- **Integrated with SST**: Use SST to manage your serverless resources.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Built-in support for styling your application.
- **Linting and Formatting**: Pre-configured with ESLint and Prettier.
- **GitHub Workflows**: CI/CD setup for automated testing and deployment.

## Getting Started

To set up your Next.js SST Starter project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tofu1304/nextjs-sst-starter.git

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **SST**: A framework for building serverless applications on AWS.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Pulumi**: Infrastructure as code tool for managing cloud resources.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation for workflows.

## Deployment

To deploy your application to AWS, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS Credentials**: Make sure you have your AWS credentials configured. You can do this by setting the environment variables or using the AWS CLI.

2. **Deploy with SST**:
   ```bash
   npx sst deploy
   ```

3. **Check Your Deployment**: After the deployment completes, SST will provide you with a URL to access your application.

## GitHub Workflows

This repository comes with pre-configured GitHub workflows to automate testing and deployment. You can find the workflow files in the `.github/workflows` directory. These workflows will:

- Run tests on push and pull request events.
- Deploy the application on the main branch.

## Linting and Formatting

We use ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting. You can run the following commands to lint and format your code:

- **Lint**:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Format**:
